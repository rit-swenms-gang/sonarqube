# Project Proposal

## Overview

SonarQube is a developer tool to perform static analysis on source code
repositories. Its primary goals are to improve code quality and security
through the enforcement of best practices. It automates the detection of
linting and formatting issues, monitors code coverage of tests, catches
common security vulnerabilities, and more. Through this tools, developers
are able to more strictly enforce standards and practices. The end result
is software that is more secure, performant, and–most
importantly–maintainable.

SonarQube is highly flexible. The application is offered on the cloud
or can be hosted on-prem. It can be included in continuous integration
pipelines to perform checks frequently, and is highly configurable to fit
a developer's need for many projects.
While written in Java, SonarQube supports a variety of languages and
paradigms–including dynamically-typed languages (Python, JavaScript),
low-level programming languages (C, Rust), and other widely-used
programming tools (Kubernetes, Docker).
One of the major appeals of SonarQube is its ability to generate actionable
tasks to improve software based on quality metrics, such as reliability,
understandability, and maintainability.
