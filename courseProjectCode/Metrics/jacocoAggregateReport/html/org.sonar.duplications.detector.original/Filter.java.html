/**
 * Performs incremental and brute force algorithm in order to filter clones, which are fully covered by other clones.
 * All clones for filtering must be of the same origin - there is no sanity check on this.
 * In a worst case it performs O(N*N) comparisons.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Godin: This implementation was chosen because it simple.
 * And I wasn't able to find big difference in performance with an interval tree, which we had for the moment of testing.
 * Whereas in fact I expected that interval tree would be better for this task.
 * Moreover with interval tree we also can use incremental approach,
 * but we did not had an implementation with remove operation for the moment of testing.

   * Clone A is contained in another clone B, if every part pA from A has part pB in B,

   * &lt;pre&gt;
   * (pA.resourceId == pB.resourceId) and (pB.unitStart &lt;= pA.unitStart) and (pA.unitEnd &lt;= pB.unitEnd)
   * &lt;/pre&gt;

   * &lt;pre&gt;

   * &lt;strong&gt;Important: this method relies on fact that all parts were already sorted by resourceId and unitStart by using
